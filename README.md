# Turnip Terror

`Multiplayer-Couch-Turnip-Game` 

Let's get root! You are evil... and hungry. Your mission: to harvest innocent baby-turnips for a delicious salad. But beware of the rootmother...

Players harvest turnips by typing keyboard/Joypad combos. However, as soon as the mother turnip is watching, they must cease their harvest, lest they wish to sustain her wrath . Whoever has the most points at the end wins.
